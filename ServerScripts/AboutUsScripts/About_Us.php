        TSSV  is an online test conducting tool aimed at creating self evaluation tests for competitive examination preparations. The tool will be provided in the Software as a Service business model. It is aimed at improving the students preparation for an exam.

        Quizzes in Engineering Colleges and many more.
        Many of the tests mentioned above were being conducted offline. With better infrastructure available now, tests are being conducted online. The main advantages of conducting tests online is that the evaluation is easy and results are accurate and can be provided quickly. A considerable number of students take tuitions and other forms of coaching to crack these competitive exams.

        The coaching centres provide an impeccable and amazing coaching but fail to give the students the feel of the online tests. This is because, they cannot afford hiring people to make tools to create tests. Hence, in most small institutes a traditional pen paper test is still given.
        This is where our TSSV tool comes in. We provide a test preparation software for small education institutes and coaching centres to make their students exam-ready. The model we will adopt will be as that of Software as a service (SaaS). Software as a service sometimes referred to as "on- demand software", is a software delivery model in which software and associated data are centrally hosted on the cloud. SaaS is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser. We will  provide a back end for private institutions to upload content and manage results and report generation. 
        At the same time, the front end provided to the students will help him analyze his performance in each test and compare and contrast his performance as against the class and his individual performance in different segments of the test. Our business model is clear. We will not provide content ourselves. We will only provide the software to the content owners (i.e the private institutions.) The institutions can use this and provide content and host tests and charge the money. We will charge per user login.
         We believe in the concept of decentralized commerce. This means that we will neither own the content nor will we produce the content required for the online test taking. We only provide the tools and technologies required for content owners like private institutions who can host their tests on or platform.
         But, what is the unique selling point? There are many online test creation websites which help in test conduction.
