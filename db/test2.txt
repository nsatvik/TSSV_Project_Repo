INTRODUCTION
IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) [1]
is a singularly interesting networking technology.
It is the application of contemporary compute
power and a state of the art control plane to
replace spanning tree protocols. In essence it is a
combination of standard and proven components
that have been specified by the IEEE with algorithms
that construct connectivity based on the
shortest paths. This is achieved while preserving
key aspects of the Ethernet architecture. The
basics of the technology have previously been
discussed in this journal in [2] and [3].
SPB takes advantage of key attributes of the
design of Ethernet to permit the consolidation
of a number of control protocols into the combination
of a single link state routing protocol
(IS-IS) [4] and enhanced algorithms for the computation
of both unicast and multicast forwarding.
One consequence of this consolidation is a
radically simplified control plane with a significantly
diminished messaging load. This becomes
a virtuous circle as reducing the number of messages
exchanged as an artifact of normal network
operation diminishes the number of
interruptions the control plane is required to
handle when computing.
Another key attribute of the Ethernet technology
base is the concept of Virtual LAN
(VLAN) as a vertical partition of the network.
That is, each VLAN may comprise a different
subset of the physical topology, and SPB ensures
full connectivity on a shortest path within each
VLAN. SPB does enable Ethernet to overcome
the limitations of spanning trees and fully utilize
much richer topologies. The combination of path
computation, shortest path forwarding, and the
use of VLANs opens up new possibilities in the
efficient use of the breadth of connectivity within
the bounds of the existing Ethernet technology
base.
THE PROBLEM SPACE
SPB is expected to make efficient use of a variety
of arbitrary networking topologies with an
absolute minimum of operator intervention.
These can range from sparse mesh or dual
homed hub and spoke in the metro up to Clos
or “fat tree” [5] architectures employed in the
datacenter. Frequently, the offered load in the
network will not match the topology or routing
system, resulting in “hot spots”. Operators need
the ability to shift load away from a hot spot.
It is well understood that a single shortest
path solution in the network will not make good
utilization of a network, and is difficult to manipulate
due to the sensitivity of shortest path forwarding
to metric manipulation. This has led the
industry to implement multi-path solutions.
Most frequently deployed today is per hop
Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP). In most implementations,
when the presence of multiple equal
cost next hops is encountered, the packet is
inspected for a source of entropy (typically an IP
header), and a hash of header information modulo
the number of next hops is used to select the
next hop for the particular packet. It will distribute
load well in very regular topologies, but
for asymmetric topologies or failure scenarios
the distribution of load will be perturbed across
the network as the load spreading view is based
only on a view of the next hop and not the network
beyond the next hop. Reactive measures to
address hot spots are difficult as a multi-path
design tends to “lock in” the metrics used; hence,
shifting load off a specific link or node is not
easily addressed. Further, ECMP frequently
requires additional packet processing inherent to
the next hop selection process. Finally. as far as
Ethernet is concerned, this would be a significant
change to existing implementations and a
major architectural change as congruence of forward-
backward and unicast-multicast forwarding
would be lost, and data plane OAM [3] would
require a significant re-design. The reason for
this is that per-hop ECMP cannot be applied to
multicast. So while ECMP preserves flow ordering
for unicast, virtualized bridging utilizing a
combination of unicast and multicast (for flood-
